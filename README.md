# Donghee Hoh — Research Website

This is my personal academic website hosted on GitHub Pages.  
I built it to share my research on photosynthetic regulation, natural genetic diversity, and plant resilience.

## How to deploy
1. Create a repository named `<username>.github.io`, or use an existing repo with GitHub Pages enabled on the `main` branch.  
2. Upload the website files to the repository.  
3. Edit text in `index.html`, `research.html`, `publications.html`, and `contact.html` as needed.  
4. Replace or update images in the `assets/` folder (for example, `assets/Main2.png` for the homepage background).

The overall style and color theme can be customized in `css/site.css`.
